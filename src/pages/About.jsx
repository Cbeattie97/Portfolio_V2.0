      <h2> A Bit About Me</h2>
      <p>
      I’m Cameron Beattie, a full-stack web developer based in Australia. 
      After over a decade in the construction industry, I transitioned into tech, 
      where I’m combining my hands-on problem-solving skills with web development. 
      I’m currently focused on building web applications using technologies like 
      JavaScript, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I’m also learning Python for 
      AI-based automation and am particularly interested in creating tools that 
      streamline workflows and enhance productivity. Outside of coding, I’m an 
      avid Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu practitioner and enjoy working on home renovation 
      projects. Feel free to reach out to learn more or collaborate on exciting projects!
